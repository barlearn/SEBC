On the master MySQL node, grant replication privileges for your replica node:
a. Log in with mysql -u ... -p 
b. Note the FQDN of your replica host.
c. mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'user'@'FQDN' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
d. mysql> SET GLOBAL binlog_format = 'ROW'; 
e. mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;

In a second terminal session, log into the MySQL master and show its status:
a. mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
b. Make note of the file name and byte offset. The replica needs this info to sync to the master.
c. Logout of the second session; remove the lock on the first with mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
